# HousePrice-Predictor
These projects are part of a collection of models part of the House Price Predictor contest. There are multiple models such as multivariate regression, decision trees, SVGs. I learned valuable information through visualising the housing data and understanding which features to specifically train the model for to develop the highest accuracy and score. I placed in the top 10% of this challenge on kaggle.
